	year = {2005},
	month = {November},
	address = {Washington, DC},
	abstract = {Majority of papers in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have an element of energy-efficiency and associated with it an analysis of network lifetime. Yet, there is no agreement on how to analyze the lifetime of a WSN. As a result, errors are frequently made on both sides. Some underestimate the network lifetime by an order of magnitude, while others end up overestimating the lifetime by a significant factor. This paper presents a first step towards standardizing the lifetime analysis of WSNs. We focus on WSNs deployed for always-on applications, where the problem of power management is most severe because the environment needs to be monitored continuously. Underestimation of network lifetime is common when proposing sleep-wakeup schemes, where it is frequently assumed that in the absence of a sleep-wakeup scheme, a sensor node from the Mica family lasts 3-5 days on a pair of AA batteries. We show that the same sensor node can be made to last more than 36 days, even if it is continuously monitoring the environment. Overestimation typically occurs when proposing non-sleep-wake up power management schemes such as in-network data aggregation. Overestimation occurs because several network activities (e.g periodic routing messages) are assumed to have negligible effect on the network lifetime and therefore are ignored in the lifetime analysis. We use our recent experience in deploying ExScal (a large-scale WSN for intrusion detection) to identify major components in the network lifetime analysis. We then present a careful lifetime analysis of ExScal and show how to analyze the effects of using various non-sleep-wake up power management schemes such as hierarchical sensing, low-power listening, and in-network data aggregation on the network lifetime. Our lifetime analysis will be useful as a template in analyzing the lifetime of other WSNs deployed for always-on applications.},

	abstract = {An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. Furthermore, the network must be able to configure itself to any feasible degree of coverage and connectivity in order to support different applications and environments with diverse requirements. This article presents the design and analysis of novel protocols that can dynamically configure a network to achieve guaranteed degrees of coverage and connectivity. This work differs from existing connectivity or coverage maintenance protocols in several key ways. (1) We present a Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) that can provide different degrees of coverage requested by applications. This flexibility allows the network to self-configure for a wide range of applications and (possibly dynamic) environments. (2) We provide a geometric analysis of the relationship between coverage and connectivity. This analysis yields key insights for treating coverage and connectivity within a unified framework; in sharp contrast to several existing approaches that address the two problems in isolation. (3) We integrate CCP with SPAN to provide both coverage and connectivity guarantees. (4) We propose a probabilistic coverage model and extend CCP to provide probabilistic coverage guarantees. We demonstrate the capability of our protocols to provide guaranteed coverage and connectivity configurations through both geometric analysis and extensive simulations.},

	abstract = {Network lifetime has become the key characteristic for evaluating sensor networks in an application specific way. Especially the availability of nodes, the sensor coverage, and the connectivity have been included in discussions on network lifetime. Even quality of service measures can be reduced to lifetime considerations. A great number of algorithms and methods were proposed to increase the lifetime of a sensor network - while their evaluations were always based on a particular definition of network lifetime. Motivated by the great differences in existing definitions of sensor network lifetime that are used in relevant publications, we reviewed the state of the art in lifetime definitions, their differences, advantages, and limitations. This survey was the starting point for our work towards a generic definition of sensor network lifetime for use in analytic evaluations as well as in simulation models - focusing on a formal and concise definition of accumulated network lifetime and total network lifetime. Our definition incorporates the components of existing lifetime definitions, and introduces some additional measures. One new concept is the ability to express the service disruption tolerance of a network. Another new concept is the notion of time-integration: in many cases, it is sufficient if a requirement is fulfilled over a certain period of time, instead of at every point in time. In addition, we combine coverage and connectivity to form a single requirement called connected coverage. We show that connected coverage is different from requiring non-combined coverage and connectivity. Finally, our definition also supports the concept of graceful degradation by providing means of estimating the degree of compliance with the application requirements. We demonstrate the applicability of our definition based on the surveyed lifetime definitions as well as using some example scenarios to explain the various aspects influencing sensor network lifetime.},

number of routing schemes that use the limited resources

always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the
point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To
optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called
energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally
to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also
presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40%
over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes
also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network
ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.},

We contrast this with the applicability of a more exact Two-Ray Interference model. A key result is that, in most cases, the commonly used simplified Two-Ray Ground models add no additional value compared to the most simple Free-space model â€“ in particular in highway and suburban environments. We further argue that replacing a simplified with a fully featured Two-Ray Interference model can not only substantially improve the accuracy of simulation results but also allow capturing one notable artifact that becomes immediately visible in field tests, namely strong signal attenuation at short and medium ranges. We implemented the Two-ray Interference model within the Veins simulation framework and validated it using analytical predictions and field measurements. We show the impact of the more accurate Two-Ray Interference model, which only comes with negligible additional computational cost for simulation experiments.},

It provides detailed models of the wireless channel (fading, etc.), wireless connectivity, mobility models, models for obstacles and many communication protocols especially at the Medium Access Control (MAC) level. Further, it provides a user-friendly graphical representation of wireless and mobile networks in OMNeT++, supporting debugging and defining even complex wireless scenarios.

Conceptually, platooning means creating clusters of vehicles which closely follow each other autonomously without action of the driver, neither for accelerating, nor for braking. This leads to several important benefits from substantially improved road throughput to increased safety. The control of such platoons depends on two components: First, radar is typically to be used to control the distance between the vehicles, and secondly, Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) helps managing the entire platoon allowing cars to join or to leave the group whenever necessary. Platooning systems have been mostly investigated in controlled environments such as dedicated highways with centralized management. However, platooning-enabled cars will be deployed gradually and might have to travel on highways together with other non-automated vehicles. We developed a combined traffic and network simulator for studying strategies and protocols needed for managing platoons in such mixed scenarios. We show the models needed and present first results using a simple IVC-based platoon management as a proof of concept.},

	abstract = {In the scientific community, Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols are frequently evaluated using simulation techniques, often using variants of WiFi stacks instead of IEEE 802.11p, which constitutes the basis for the new DSRC/WAVE standard. We discuss the necessity of using accurate WAVE models based on an extensive set of simulation experiments using: an IEEE 802.11b model, an IEEE 802.11b model tweaked to work in the same frequency range and using similar timings like IEEE 802.11p, as well as a fully featured channel hopping WAVE model. Even though, intuitively, the use of the different protocols will lead to a different network behavior, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no qualitative and quantitative evaluation or comparison of both worlds. According to our results, we can conclude that the simple WiFi model may indeed be used, but only for extremely sparse scenarios ¿ this is exactly what has been validated using field tests. In more dense scenarios there is a significant deviation of the protocol behavior between WiFi (and its adapted variant) compared to WAVE. Thus, especially in dense scenarios, the application behavior is strongly influenced if simulated with the wrong model - leading to unrealistic results.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) promises to reduce accidents by enabling assistance systems such as cross-traffic assistance. This application needs movement information from vehicles that are potentially in Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) due to buildings at intersection corners. The amount of NLOS is determined by the placements of buildings. From another point of view, buildings influence the DSRC wireless channel by creating radio signal reflections and diffraction. Here, existing NLOS path-loss models for cellular communication with below roof-top base stations hint that the spatial placement of buildings has influence on the NLOS reception quality. This paper analyzes building positioning in the City of Munich with respect to DSRC. In a first step, it is investigated how much the line-of-sight is blocked by buildings. In a second step, the location of buildings is abstracted and load, the resulting data clustered to find a set of representative buildingposition scenarios. The presented scenario knowledge can be used in future research to configure meaningful simulations that investigate the radio channel at intersections under and tests., to select representative intersections for radio propagation field},

	abstract = {In the future intervehicle communication will make driving safer, easier, and more comfortable. As a cornerstone of the system, vehicles need to be aware of other vehicles in the vicinity. This cooperative awareness is achieved by beaconing, the exchange of periodic single-hop broadcast messages that include data on the status of a vehicle. While the concept of beaconing has been developed in the first phase of research on VANETs, recent studies have revealed limitations with respect to network performance. Obviously, the frequency of beacon messages directly translates into accuracy of cooperative awareness and thus traffic safety. There is an indisputable trade-off between required bandwidth and achieved accuracy. In this work we analyze this trade-off from different perspectives considering the consequences for safety applications. As a solution to the problem of overloading the channel, we propose to control the offered load by adjusting the beacon frequency dynamically to the current traffic situation while maintaining appropriate accuracy. To find an optimal adaptation, we elaborate on several options that arise when determining the beacon frequency. As a result, we propose situation-adaptive beaconing. It depends on the vehicle's own movement and the movement of surrounding vehicles, macroscopic aspects like the current vehicle density, or microscopic aspects.},

	abstract = {Recently, many efforts have been made to develop more efficient Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols for on-demand route planning according to observed traffic congestion or incidents, as well as for safety applications. Because practical experiments are often not feasible, simulation of network protocol behavior in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) scenarios is strongly demanded for evaluating the applicability of developed network protocols. In this work, we discuss the need for bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic microsimulation for evaluating IVC protocols. As the selection of a mobility model inﬂuences the outcome of simulations to a great deal, the use of a representative model is necessary for producing meaningful evaluation results. Based on these observations, we developed the hybrid simulation framework Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation), composed of the network simulator OMNeT++ and the road traffic simulator SUMO. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate its advantages and the need for bidirectionally coupled simulation based on the evaluation of two protocols for incident warning over VANETs. With our developed methodology, we can advance the state-of-the-art in performance evaluation of IVC and provide means to evaluate developed protocols more accurately.},

Especially for evaluating safety applications in the field of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), stochastic models are not sufficient for evaluating the radio communication in simulation. Motivated by similar work on WiFi measurements, we therefore created an empirical model for modeling buildings and their properties to accurately simulate the signal propagation. We validated our model using real world measurements in a city scenario for different types of obstacles.

As such, TIS are much less delay sensitive compared to safety applications, which have recently attracted a lot of attention in VANET research. We propose a new message dissemination protocol, Adaptive Traffic Beacon (ATB), which is fully distributed and uses adaptive beaconing based on two key metrics: 1) the message utility; and 2) the channel quality. It is shown that adaptive beaconing leads to a much broader dissemination of messages (in terms of penetration rate) than flooding-based approaches, albeit at a slower rate. Adaptive beaconing thus seems to be much more suitable for TIS than flooding-based protocols.},

These characteristics shed light on the key routing performance metrics of interest in disconnected VANETs, such as the average time taken to propagate a packet to disconnected nodes (i.e., the re-healing time). Our results show that, depending on the sparsity of vehicles or the market penetration rate of cars using Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology, the network re-healing time can vary from a few seconds to several minutes. This suggests that, for vehicular safety applications, a new ad hoc routing protocol will be needed as the conventional ad hoc routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) will not work with such long re-healing times. In addition, the developed analytical framework and regime., its predictions provide valuable insights into the VANET routing performance in the disconnected network},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel distributed asynchronous multichannel medium access control (MAC) scheme for large-scale vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), i.e., asynchronous multichannel medium access control with a distributed time-division multiple-access mechanism (AMCMAC-D). The proposed scheme supports simultaneous transmissions on different service channels while allowing rendezvous and broadcast of emergency messages on the control channel. The scheme is distributed, because it handles access to the shared control channel for different access categories without relying on the beacon frames from roadside units. This condition eliminates the overhead that is associated with channel allocation, making the proposed scheme suitable for large-scale networks in terms of the number of active nodes. Service differentiation in the proposed scheme is enhanced by allocating different numbers of time slots for different access categories. We compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the IEEE 1609.4 standard and the asynchronous multichannel Coordination Protocol (AMCP) in terms of throughput, packet delivery rate, collision rate, utilization of service channels, service differentiation, and the penetration rate of noncollided emergency messages. The results show that AMCMAC-D outperforms the IEEE 1609.4 standard and AMCP in terms of system throughput by increasing the utilization of the control channel and service channels. The proposed scheme also demonstrates better performance in terms of packet delivery rate, collision rate on a service channel, load balancing, and service differentiation. Finally, AMCMAC-D mitigates the multichannel hidden terminal and missing receiver problems, which occur in asynchronous multichannel MAC schemes.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the new IEEE 802.11p DSRC/WAVE radios, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications is poised for a dramatic leap. A canonical application for these future vehicular networks is the detection and notification of anomalous road events (e.g., potholes, bumps, icy road patches, etc.). We present the Road Information Sharing Architecture (RISA), the first distributed approach to road condition detection and aggregation, dissemination for vehicular networks. RISA provides for the in-network and reliability, dissemination of event information detected by multiple vehicles in a timely manner for improved information and deployed, bandwidth efficiency. RISA uses a novel Time-Decay Sequential Hypothesis Testing (TD-SHT) approach in which event information from multiple sources is combined with time-varying beliefs. We describe our implementation of RISA which has been and traces., tested on a fleet of vehicles on-site at the GM Warren Technical Center in Michigan. We further provide a comprehensive evaluation of the aggregation mechanism using emulation of the RISA code on real vehicular mobility},

	abstract = {Our investigations in understanding the physical mechanism of the LOS microcellular channel reveal that the principle source of slow fading is the random interference pattern of a few strong contributing paths which causes what we term as deceptive shadowing. It is shown that in a comparative curve fitting of slow fading, Nakagami distribution also fits the fading data. Also in non-zero mean complex Gaussian channels, the segregation of slow and fast fading using moving mean normalization is illusionary as the fading parameters in both cases remain the same. We argue that radio link performance calculation based on the segregation of slow and fast fading are therefore unnecessary for Rice/lognormal or Nakagami/lognormal fading models and may be avoided in order to simplify complex analyses.},
